# Genetic Flappy Bird
This small project was build using a small custom implementation of Neural Network build by [Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS/), P5js and Bootstrap. The same can be replicated using [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
<p>
The main reason behind using custom implementation of Neural Network was that it is more light weight and can be easily tweaked further for a specific problem.

## For Developers
Setup is pretty simple and you only need vsCode ( just for it's live server extension )
1. git clone https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/geneticFlappyBird.io.git
2. cd geneticFlappyBird.io
3. Open the `index.html` file using the live server extension and you are good to go!!!
